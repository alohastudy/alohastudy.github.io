# About AlohaStudy

AlohaStudy is a Meteor application designed to provide students a listing of hidden study spots. In this site, you will be provided a listing with ratings, hours, capacity, accessibility, and capabilities of each study spot. It will also include a feature allowing students to give real-time feedback if it's either used or not used with a timestamp. 


# Installation
First, [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).

Second, [download a copy of AlohaStudy](https://github.com/alohastudy/alohastudy/archive/master.zip), or clone it using git.

Third, cd into the app/ directory and install libraries with:

```
$ meteor npm install
```

Fourth, run the system with:

```
$ meteor npm run start
```

If all goes well, the application will appear at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). If you have an account on the UH test CAS server, you can login.
