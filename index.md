# About AlohaStudy

AlohaStudy is a Meteor application designed to provide students a listing of hidden study spots. In this site, you will be provided a listing with ratings, hours, capacity, accessibility, and capabilities of each study spot. It will also include a feature allowing students to give real-time feedback if it's either used or not used with a timestamp.

This application will give students the access and convenience of knowing where and when to go to hidden study spots.
